# IUS Automation Examples

There are a lot of great automation tools to aid in the setup and configuration
of servers.  This repository contains some examples to automate anything to do
with IUS.  Some of these examples might need to be modified for your
deployments.  Pull requests are welcome.

Please note, the master branch will only include this README.md file.  We will
use separate branches for each automation technology.
